## Guidelines for adding a new component

When adding new components, please try and follow the following guidelines as closely as possible to ensure maximum ease of use and maintanability.

 * Ensure that the component has well documented headers.
 * Aggressivly use namespacing (method prefix) for Objective-C categories in order to avoid potential naming collisions.
